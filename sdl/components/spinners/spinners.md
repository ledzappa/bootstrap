# Usage and description
Just add `spinner` class to div element and optionally the class `light` to spinner element when placed against light (grey) background. Control sizing by adding `spinner-sm`, `spinner-md` or `spinners-lg`. No size class means default size which is between `spinner-sm` and `spinner-md`.  

## Base state
This is the default state of the component
```html
<div class="spinner" role="status">
  <span class="sr-only">Loading...</span>
</div>
```
