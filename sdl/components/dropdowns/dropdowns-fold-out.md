# Usage and description
**Framework needed!** Please note that the example provided on the link below is just a representation of how dropdowns look and the needed markup. In order to use dropdowns you need a framework to control when and how they are shown. If you're using angular, please take a look at [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/dropdowns/examples) and their dropdown component, it's also possible to use the [popover component](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/popover/examples) to accomplish the same thing. Which one you should use depends on the content you want to fold out, if it's a menu use, dropdown if custom element use popover.
