# Usage and description
Just use anchor tags like you would normally, optionally you could add `btn btn-link` to buttons to make them behave as normal links. 

## Base state
This is the default state of the component
```html
       <a href="#" target="_blank">Just a normal link</a>
       <button class="btn btn-link">Button behaving as a link</button>
```
