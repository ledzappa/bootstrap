# Usage and description
**Framework needed!** Please note that the example provided on the link below is just a representation of how accordions look and the needed markup. In order to use accordion you need a framework to control when and how to toggle between active states. If you're using angular, please take a look at [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/) and their [accordion component](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/components/accordion/examples).

## Base state
This is the default state of the component
